# C3SL - TRAINING CAMP

A project from my training period at C3SL. A web application that displays a index of public servers at a imaginary minister.

## Introduction

This project is one of the first "cool" things that i´ve ever code, some bugs may happen and some things could be better, but i´m still improving and learning. Hope you like!

## Instructions

First, clone the project and then run the following command to install all the packages of it:

```
npm i
```
Then, run the command bellow to open the live servers (first open the backend server and after open the frontend server) :

```

If you want a full experience of the app, install "Insomnia" to help you with the requests. You can download "Insomnia" with the following command:

```
sudo snap install insomnia
```
